							<p>In order to resolve the problem previously researched, we conducted an anonymous survey through social media with a majority of responses from Cupertino High and a few varied responses from other schools such as Monta Vista or Westmont. The goal of the survey was to gather information related to the chronic obesity problem within teens attending our school district and to derive a feasible solution to this issue.</p>
	<p>The information that the survey inquired for focused mostly on the individual’s current physical stature and size and also their impressions regarding the foods currently served in the cafeteria. Additionally, their current opinions towards possible HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) and potential transparency of the foods were taken into account as well. Using the values received, we were able to calculate their corresponding BMI and locate where they ranged within the BMI categories. The data presented an average BMI of around 23 which is located at the upper end of “Normal Weight” and nears “Overweight.” This information and the mildy larger than average value for public concern of health of 3.3 led us to begin devising our solution to curb obesity rates in our community.</p>

	<p>Since the general public seemed to place importance in the nutrition values of their meals, we decided that there was no need to take extremely drastic measures such as removing one type of food completely. The solution that we came up with was to simply discourage the students from purchasing unhealthy foods and drinks by making them seem less appealing as well as inducing some guilt. Research conducted by the Massachusetts General Hospital and published in the American Journal of Public Health reveals that bottled water can be placed in strategic positions around a cafeteria to influence the the sales of different types of nutrition (<em>Figure 1</em>). Adding water bottles around every food station would entice more students to pick those up instead of the sugary drinks and foods that they were initially thinking about and lower the amount of unhealthy meals sold. Additionally, increasing the price of junk foods slightly would also have a beneficial effect on the diets of students and the deficit caused by less students purchasing those foods would be made up for by the greater sales price.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, the problem of obesity isn’t extremely tragic in our communities and the corresponding solution won’t need to be extremely drastic as well. By simply restructuring the setup within the cafeteria and slightly increasing the price of junk foods, we could easily attain a lower level of obesity within our school districts while maintaining minimal deficits.</p>
