							<h1>Estimated Finnancial Expenditure</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/costs.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>After looking at the survey and finding out that the average BMI of our school and community was 23, which is very close to the overweight BMI of  25.Our\group also realized that over 70% of our school is self conscious, which influences why the percent of people who like school lunches are under 10%. To fix this problem and to promote healthy lunches, our group came us with two solutions. The addition of healthier snacks into the lunch program as well as posters of information in the cafeteria about the calories and nutrients served inside.</p>
							<p>Similar to restaurant chains such as McDonalds, our method is to post a poster with all the nutrition details on a large poster in the cafeteria, so students can see what they are eating and the ingredients of the foods. This helps with the students being able to maintain a healthier lifestyle. Since there are many foods in the lunch line, it is decided to go with a large 36” by 48” poster. The cost of creating this poster will be $40.60, which includes shipping to the school.</p>
							<p>The other plan change is the introduction of healthier snacks into our lunch system. Trail mix is one of the snacks, instead of sugary fruit snacks, we add a healthier alternative. Trail mix is $16.99 dollars per a pack of 28, which approximates to $0.95-$0.97 per package. For fruit snacks,it $13.99 for a pack of 80, which approximates to $0.17-$0.19 per package. The plan is to sell the trail mix at a price of $1.75, as well as increase the price of the fruit snacks from a dollar to 1.50 dollars. This will influence students to choose a healthier choice as well as still get profit/maintain a similar budget. Another addition is to the drinks, the lunch line in Cupertino sells many sugary drinks such as ICE or gatorade.Instead of these sugary drinks,we plan to add a healthier drink such as V8 Juice, which is made up of 100% vegetable juice.</p>
							<p>The ICE drink is about 90 cents to a dollar when bought in bulk. While the V8 Juice Cans is 14 dollars for a pack of 28, which is about 50 cents per drink. It can be seen that the V8 cans are actually more budget friendly then the ICE drinks and can be sold at a cheaper cost and as a healthier option. The projected plan is to replace these sugary drinks with the healthier vegetable juice. </p>
								To further these propositions and obtain confirmations of these budget implications, the FUHSD food services department is very important. As it is their goal to provide healthy meals to the students within FUHSD, this subject will be of interest to them. These small but effective and useful changes will promote healthiness and well as only require a small budget, which is favorable towards the food departments. </p>
