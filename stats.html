							<p>Through the data we gathered, a majority of the people go to Cupertino High School, are male, and are also Seniors. This is a great thing because Seniors have the been at our school the longest, so they are more aware of our cafeteria food. </p>
								<p>After calculating the BMI using everyone’s height and weight, we find that the average BMI is about 23, which is right below the obesity zone of 24. This shows that the population of our respondents are generally healthy, but most are on the brink of obesity. Along with the height and weight, we also found out that only 7% of the people who took the survey eat from the cafeteria food. At first, this is a shocking statistic but after looking into how the students view the food in the cafeteria we can see why most of them do not eat at the cafeteria. For example, only about 15% of the people think that the food in the cafeteria is highly nutritious while a whopping 47% think that it has low nutrition. This explains why about 47% of the people eat outside of school and 46% bring food from home. </p>
								<p>As seen in the graph, the majority of the respondents also stated that the cafeteria food does not meet their expectation in taste, nutrition, price, and quantity. With this in mind, my group and I realized that we should make food more appealing at our school cafeteria while also making it more healthy, and one place that does appeal to people in our school is Subway. Our group discussed how we can have our own Subway-style lunch in which the person chooses the parts of their sandwich. The idea is the school can buy organic ingredients form wholesalers like Costco and sell them at a little markup, and also have 2 vegetables included in the sandwich. The financial analyst should have more information on the cost of that idea, but we feel as if that would fix the issue that students have with taste, nutrition, and also quantity. </p>
								<p>Another factor we realized is that most of the people do realize that most of our foods have high fructose corn syrup. This can include foods such as pop tarts, juice, and more. And lastly, about 3/4th of the respondents want more transparency with the nutrition values in our meals. Our group discussed that we can have a nutritional breakdown on each of the foods that are being sold in the cafeteria to meet everyone’s expectation. We can do this by showing how many calories are in each specific serving, how much protein is in each serving, and more. In conclusion, there are many changes that we can make to the cafeteria to improve student happiness and health.</p>
