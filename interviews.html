							<h1>Our Interviews</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/interview.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The issue that my group and I are trying to tackle is the quality and nutrition of the food students receive from the Cupertino High School Cafeteria. To begin with, our group already knew the nutritional value of the food we get is low and the price for the quality did not really match. Due to these problems, we decided to uphold the task of researching the nutritional value, student satisfaction, and possible ways of solving the problem. Since I have the community outreach role, I was asked to conduct interviews with persons who have more experience and purpose in the cafeteria at our school.</p>
							<p>First I asked many students on their general thoughts on the food. “The lunchline food we get is pretty trash,” said one student and continues on by saying, “It kinda sucks that for the price to be so high when the food isn’t that good in the first place.” When I asked many other students, I always received a similar response in that the cafeteria food is just not worth it. Many others just replied that they bring food from home or from outside because of either because it tastes better or it is healthier, all for a way lower price. In hearing these responses, I went on to ask questions to one of the workers at the school cafeteria. The first question I asked was the same as the one I asked everyone else, “What is your general opinion on the food the students get from the lunchline?” “Taste wise I think it isn't very good. The quality of the bread is poor, the food is pretty bland and the choices are repetitive” said the worker.
							<p>This response led me to ask, “How about nutritionally?” The worker responded by saying, “Nutritionally I think they're passable but nowhere near nutritious. I mean they do offer salad and fruits so that apps the nutritional factor But definitely could be healthier for sure.” This response was not shocking but was still somewhat surprising since it came from one who actually works and helps make the food. The worker also said that the only reason why he can’t eat from outside is that he receives the food for free, but if he was an average student, he would rather eat from outside.</p>
							<p>The final question I asked was of the price of the food and the quality. To this, he responded, “I feel like the portions are pretty small and the food is pretty poor quality wise compared to the price. It might be worth it though if you get a salad, fruit, and a drink rather than just the main course.” When asked if the prices were more suitable, would the students have a more positive attitude towards the food, the worker replies by saying, “I don't really think so cause I feel like students will complain about the poor quality of the food regardless.” Although the cafeteria offers fruits and salads, most of the students would rather not buy these foods. The rest of the food most certainly lacks the quality and nutritional value to be healthy for the students at our school. Another important detriment we must change is the pricing of the foods. For the quality of the foods the students receive, the price of the foods should be reasonably cheaper that matches the quality. Due to this problem, many students buy food from outside or bring food from home which has more guaranteed quality and nutrition. To conclude from the various statements from the students and workers, improving school nutrition is a mandatory action in which the administration must take.
